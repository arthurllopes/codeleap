## About the development process: 
  Started off by creating the system skelleton, creating folders for the pages and components I would probably need. Then, I did all the pages and components layout, and populated the informations with static data. After that, I added redux and created all the user functionalities. Finally, I used the system to see if everything was working correctly.
